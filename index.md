# 🇬🇧 Deadlock UK RP | Low-Pop Community Guidelines

Welcome to **Deadlock UK**. As a growing community, our rules are designed to prioritize **quality interaction** over rigid restrictions. In a low-population environment, every player counts—be the reason someone wants to stay.

> **Requirement:** Deadlock UK is an **18+ server**. You must be 18 years of age or older. No exceptions.

## 1. The Growth Mindset
* **Interaction Over "Winning":** On a smaller server, if you kill everyone you meet, you’ll quickly have no one to play with. Focus on conversations, kidnapping over killing, and "leaving them with a story."
* **English Only:** To ensure everyone can participate, English is the mandatory language for all IC and Discord interactions.
* **Zero Tolerance:** Hate speech, racism, and OOC toxicity will result in an immediate ban. We want a welcoming community.

---

## 2. Roleplay Quality & Immersion
* **Serious RP:** Maintain your character at all times. Low population is not an excuse for "messing about" or FailRP.
* **Realistic Fear:** Value your life. If you are outnumbered or outgunned, comply.
* **No Suicide RP:** This is strictly prohibited.
* **Active RP:** Do not stay in the character selection screen. If you are in the server, you should be out in the world creating scenes.

---

## 3. Communication & Metagaming
* **Metagaming:** Do not use information from Discord or streams. On a small server, "knowing everyone" OOC is common—keep that knowledge separate from your character.
* **No Discord Comms:** You must mute/deafen on Discord while in the city. Use the in-game phones and radios to keep the immersion high.
* **Stream Sniping:** Watching other players' streams while in the city is an instant, non-appealable ban.

---

## 4. Interaction Guidelines
* **NHS & Mechanics:** These roles are vital for a small server. Do not rob or harass on-duty NHS/Mechanics. If no one is on duty, use the provided NPCs/automated systems but RP the injuries.
* **The "Tsunami":** No major criminal acts 15 minutes before or after a restart. 
* **Medical RP:** If you are downed and no NHS is online, you may "local up" after 5 minutes, but you must forget the immediate events leading to your death.
* **No "Ghosting":** Ignoring other players' attempts to RP with you is considered FailRP.

---

## 5. Combat & Respect for Life
* **RDM/VDM:** Randomly killing or ramming others is prohibited. Because the player count is lower, RDM hurts the community more—always ensure there is a clear, verbal RP reason before shots are fired.
* **KOS (Kill on Sight):** Prohibited. Interaction must occur before combat unless in a pre-approved, staff-notified gang war.
* **Safe Zones:** Hospitals and the main Mechanic hubs are Safe Zones. No crime or brandishing weapons.

---

## 6. Flexible Crime Rules
* **The "Fair Play" Rule:** In a low-pop server, the "Rule of 6" is replaced by **Scale-to-Fit**. 
    * If there are only 2 Police online, do not bring 6 people to a robbery. 
    * Keep groups balanced to ensure the Police have a fair chance to participate.
* **Chain Robbing:** Wait at least 30 minutes between heists. Do not "drain" the server's resources.
* **Hostages:** Do not use "friends" as hostages. If you can't find a hostage due to low pop, contact Staff to see if an NPC/Creative solution is allowed.
* **Pocket Wiping:** Do not take everything from a player. Take what is relevant to the scene and leave them enough to continue their day.

## 7. Gang & Firm Rules
In a growing city, gangs (Firms/Organisations) are the lifeblood of conflict. However, your goal should be to create "Road RP" that players want to be a part of, not to gatekeep the server.

* **Gang Cap:** To prevent "server monopolization," gangs are currently capped at **10 members**. This ensures one group doesn't outweigh the entire civilian/police population.
* **Identity:** Gangs must have an original UK-based name. Using IRL gang names (e.g., Zone 2, Active Gxng) is prohibited.
* **Claiming "Ends":** You may claim a specific area (e.g., a block or estate). You may defend this area, but you cannot "tax" new players or civilians just for passing through. 
* **Scaling Conflict:** While the server is low-pop, you should match the numbers of your opposition. If you are a gang of 6 and you are robbing a solo player or a duo, do not use all 6 members.
* **Gang Hopping:** If you leave a gang, you must wait **7 days** before joining another. This prevents "super-groups" from forming overnight.
* **Blood Pacts:** Serious "Blood In/Blood Out" contracts must be documented via a staff-monitored ticket.

---

## 8. Character & Identity
* **Human Models Only:** No animal models or glitched/invisible outfits.
* **Realistic Names:** No meme names or famous figures.
* **Multiple Characters:** You are allowed 3 characters. Do not use them to "bleed" info to each other. 
* **Police/NHS Lock:** If you play a specialized role (Police/NHS), you are encouraged to spend at least 50% of your playtime in that role to keep the server functional.

---

## 9. Administrative Support
* **Bug Reports:** Report any glitches via Discord. Using exploits for gain is a permanent ban.
* **Compensation:** Because we are a growing server, we are more lenient with compensation **if** you provide video evidence of a bug.
* **Reporting:** Use `/report` in-game or open a ticket. Do not break character to argue about rules.
